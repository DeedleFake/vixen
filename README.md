Vixen
=====

Vixen is a component lifetime management framework for Go inspired by [Fx][fx]. It is _not_ a dependency-injection framework, though it has some features along those lines. Instead, its primary focus is simplifying the initialization and deinitialization of interdependent components of an application.
